# Changelog

## 0.1.8-SNAPSHOT (unreleased)
## [0.1.7] - 2023-06-22

### Fixed

- Filter out generated files by excluding anything from `target.buildDir`, instead of
  using `minus(target.buildDir.files)`. The latter can sometimes lead to `FileNotFoundException`s if
  running other tasks concurrently.

## [0.1.6] - 2023-06-17

### Fixed

- Tasks will now `await()` their worker before completing their action. This considerably reduces
  memory usage.

### Fixed

- don't use coroutines from inside the ktlint worker
  in https://github.com/RBusarow/ktlint-gradle-plugin/pull/74
- make format tasks cacheable in https://github.com/RBusarow/ktlint-gradle-plugin/pull/75
- only register sourceSet-specific tasks after KGP is applied
  in https://github.com/RBusarow/ktlint-gradle-plugin/pull/76

  project directory as their input

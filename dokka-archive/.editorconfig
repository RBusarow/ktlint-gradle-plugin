# Disable auto-format for any files copied to /dokka-archive/
# These are generated by Dokka and the formatting is all over the place,
# so an auto-format like the one from the IDE commit dialog can create a huge diff.
# This behavior is also disabled by adding the following to the root .editorconfig:
#
# [**/dokka-archive/**]
# ij_formatter_enabled = false
#
root = true

ij_formatter_enabled = false
